The following excerpts are from <a href="http://www.wired.com/opinion/2013/06/why-jony-ives-and-apple-ios7-are-holding-back-the-future-of-design/">How Jony Ive’s Apple iOS 7 Hinders the Future of Design</a>, also by John Maeda via [Wired](http://wired.com/):

>"…design is really about unlocking the possibilities that lie within multiple perspectives...design is about solving a complex problem with multiple constraints"

#...

>"Design, like many disciplines, is about a diversity of approaches as **soft solutions** rather than **hard truths**. It’s a spectrum, not an either-or decision about whether to skeu or not to skeu."

#...

>"Culture is a closed loop feedback system that edits itself with the passage of time. Yet the tos-and-fros of changing styles—skeumorphism vs. flat design, ornamentation vs. modernism, and back again—represent only a fraction of what design can do because we’re in a new age, a time where many technological constraints are a thing of the past.    
    
>What we need now is to move beyond the superficial conversation about styles and incremental adjustments to boldly invent the next frontier of interface design."

#...

>##"Ultimately, good design will be born from consideration of multiple perspectives. It should be something we haven’t even dreamed of yet."
