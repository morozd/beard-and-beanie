<h3 id='i_tried_to_build_something'><a href='#building'>I tried to build something</a></h3>

<p>In the fall of 2012 I thought I was onto something huge. I noticed that everywhere I looked—in every nook and cranny of the small liberal arts college where I was studying—folks were in the midst of incredible, potentially world changing projects. I was surprised to find some of my closest friends—friends with whom I spoke daily, friends with whom I shared meals—in the midst of thoughtful projects about which they never spoke. After poking around a bit I realized that I wasn&#8217;t uniquely in the dark: there were many people doing many fascinating and important things that hardly anyone else knew anything about. In short: there were lots of individual projects going on with little to no resource sharing, collaboration, or overt cross pollination of ideas taking place.</p>

<p>I thought that this lack of collaboration, communication, and sharing was a big problem. I asked a few of my close friends, some peers, and advisors what they thought: everyone seemed to more or less agree that sharing and collaboration weren&#8217;t bad things, so I took it upon myself to help facilitate some collaboration. I did so by creating a simple online directory where projects could be listed and briefly described with a section for itemized resources. I thought that if I made a simple, searchable system where projects could be listed and described, people would come to it, cross reference their project against those listed, and see if there were any projects amenable to collaboration or sharing.</p>

<p>After putting the site together, taking special care that it&#8217;d be easy to maintain, and &#8220;evergreen&#8221; even amidst the school&#8217;s constantly changing ecosystem of I.T. staff, I began to solicit listings from the community. The initial response was by no means overwhelming, but nor was it lack luster. After a few days the site was populated with a handsome set of projects&#8230;and that was it. The directory never really caught on. While I had community support, only a few students used it, and even fewer professors. I don&#8217;t think that it helped to facilitate any collaboration whatsoever. People came to the site, listed their project, and that was, for all intents and purposes, the end.</p>

<p>Novelist Jonathan Safran Foer, in an essay for the New York Times, notes that &#8221;&#91;t&#93;echnology celebrates connectedness, but encourages retreat (<a href='http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/09/opinion/sunday/how-not-to-be-alone.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0'>How not to be alone</a>).&#8221; I fell victim to technological retreat in my effort to facilitate more open sharing and collaboration within my community. I made a system that simplified the act of communicating the specific information I was hoping to draw out of people. This sort of makes sense though, doesn&#8217;t it? I identified a lack of communication around a specific set of information (in this case, peoples&#8217; individual projects), and in order to facilitate greater communication of this specific information, I built a special space that was designated uniquely for it. The rub, however, was the very space that I built.</p>

<p>The space was designated for the display and storage of super specific information: I built something that empowered people to post their information and then to walk away from it—to retreat. I didn&#8217;t actually do anything to empower anyone to communicate with anybody else. Posting isn&#8217;t the same as sharing, nor is it necessarily communicative. The space that I built is analogous to the telephone pole in front of a grocery store: a convenient space on which to staple a flyer, walk away, and hope that someone, one day, calls. Telephone poles aren&#8217;t well known for their ability to mobilize, empower, and call together groups of individuals (the irony here being that a telephone pole supports a communications network). From the standpoint of a wannabe community builder, a flyer stapled to a telephone pole is sort of the bare minimum one could do. Instead of a telephone pole, I needed something more like a public library—a space to gather, share, learn, grow, and explore.</p>

<h3 id='interaction_experience_design'><a href='#IXd'>Interaction Experience Design</a></h3>

<p>This is my starting point for learning to practice what I have come to call <em>interaction experience design</em>, or IXd. IXd is concerned with the design, designing, and implementation of systems (be they physical, digital, or pragmatic) that help people to connect with themselves, one another, and the world. IXd differs from UX or UXd (user experience design) in that its focus is on empowering individuals to connect with one another and their environment, rather than with a service, device, or application. User interface is a vital component of IXd, however.</p>

<h3 id='transliteracy'><a href='#transliteracy'>Transliteracy</a></h3>

<p>Another key component to IXd is <a href='http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2060/1908'>transliteracy</a>, which is the ability to read, write, and interact across a wide range of platforms, tools, and media. Being transliterate is important to an IX designer because the more ways that an IX designer has of communicating, the better they will be at helping to bring people together. The role of an IX designer is fundamentally that of a translator—one who, rather than translating one language to another, translates one sort of experience into another sort of experience. Transliteracy &#8220;is derived from the verb &#8216;to transliterate,&#8217; meaning to write or print a letter or word using the closest corresponding letters of a different alphabet or language (<a href='http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2060/1908'>Thomas et al.</a>).&#8221; Likewise, an IX designer translates one sort of experience into another sort of experience through a process of transliteration, in <a href='http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2060/1908'><em>Transliteracy: Crossing divides</em>, Thomas et al.</a> note that</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#91;t&#93;his of course is nothing new, but transliteracy extends the act of transliteration and applies it to the increasingly wide range of communication platforms and tools at our disposal. From early signing and orality through handwriting, print, TV and film to networked digital media, the concept of transliteracy calls for a change of perspective away from the battles over print versus digital, and a move instead towards a unifying ecology not just of media, but of all literacies relevant to reading, writing, interaction and culture, both past and present.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Furthermore, in a <a href='https://soundcloud.com/brainpicker/judith-butler-on-reading-and-of-the-humanities'>commencement speech delivered at McGil</a>, philosopher and critical theorist Judith Butler notes the value of the humanities:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8230;to learn to read carefully and with a critical eye; to find ourselves unexpectedly in the middle of the ancient texts we are reading, but also to find ways of living, thinking, acting and reflecting that belong to times and spaces we have never known. The humanities give us a chance to read across languages and cultural differences in order to understand the vast range of perspectives in and on this world. How else can we imagine living together without this ability to see beyond where we are—to find ourselves linked with others we have never directly known. And to understand that in some abiding and urgent sense we share a world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The humanities, transliteracy, and IXd are powerful tools for connecting because they all empower folks to become aware of and to inhabit awarenesses other than their own—to experience empathy, and to be empathetic. They are tools with which one can learn to <em>read</em>, and relate. Empirical practices, such as mathematics and science, also offer ways of reading, and interpreting the world, but aren&#8217;t as overtly focused on or useful for learning to communicate with one another about things beyond mathematics, science, and/or other empirical practices. For this reason, they are excluded here—not because they aren&#8217;t useful or important, but because I don&#8217;t see them as directly necessary for learning to better communicate and connect. This notion of mine is greatly problematized when one considers communicating with something or someone that exists outside of our linguistic paradigm. Certain empirical practices, especially mathematics and physics, are often considered to be fairly universal, and thus useful for communicating outside of language—the <a href=''>golden Voyager discs</a> are an example of such extra-linguistic-communication. Leaving extra-linguistic-communication aside, by cultivating a transliterate vocabulary, and by learning to read transliterately (which is to say across and between media, as well as other sorts of schisms and divides), one is able to relate across media, gender, social-statuses, national boarders, history, cultural differences, operating systems, languages, timezones, and on and on and on and on.</p>

<p>It is my goal to learn to develop systems that facilitate, nurture, and empower empathetic communication, collaboration, and sharing in order to build community. What follows is a curriculum for doing so. Or at least the start of one. Critique, commentary, and responses are welcome.</p>

<h3 id='anomie'><a href='#anomie'>Anomie</a></h3>

<blockquote>
<p>I never learned to drive. As a kid, I saw too many fatal accidents and I grew up hating the idea. Automobiles slaughter 40,000 people a year, maim a hundred thousand more, and bring out the worst in men. Any society where a natural man—the pedestrian—becomes the intruder, and an unnatural man encased in a steel shell becomes his molester, is a science fiction nightmare.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>-Author, Ray Bradbury</p>

<p><em>Anomie</em> is a noun describing the breakdown of social bonds between an individual and their community—it comes from the Greek, <em>anomia</em>, which is also a form of aphasia affecting one&#8217;s ability to recall the names of common objects (<a href='#OxfAD'>The New Oxford American Dictionary, 3rd Edition</a>). Being able to detect anomie is a pivotal skill for effective community building because it indicates where communication and connection could be taking place but aren&#8217;t. For this reason it is our starting point.</p>

<p>In <a href='http://cyborganthropology.com/Anomie'><em>The Illustrated Dictionary of Cyborg Anthropology</em></a>, theorist and designer Amber Case notes that &#8220;anomie forms in social groups or societies that do not support the connectivity of their members,&#8221; such as on highways where</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#91;t&#93;he daily commute in the solitary vehicle is one of the most isolated urban human experiences. The highway space is a modern anomie: nowhere is family, or connectedness established. Though individuals are connected in traffic, this connection is generally one of mutual frustration. The annoyance, while communal, pits each vehicle driver against the others’ irregularities and driving styles. Contact between drivers on the highway is generally one of misfortune or anger (13).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Enter <a href='http://www.waze.com/'>Waze</a>, a smartphone application that creates one-off social networks by connecting nearby drivers. Like Facebook or Twitter, central to Waze&#8217;s functionality is users&#8217; ability to post status updates. Unlike Facebook or Twitter, however, these status updates are restricted to being about only one thing: current road conditions. Waze isn&#8217;t a classically communicative social network; it collects, aggregates, and analyzes user data to combat the anomie of highways by empowering highway-goers to share realtime data with one another. So, while individual highway-goers aren&#8217;t really getting to know one another, Waze helps to reduce the anomie of the system by making it a bit more efficient, and potentially reducing friction (i.e. collisions) between highway-goers.</p>

<p>A fundamental failing of my directory of projects was that it didn&#8217;t do anything to address anomie—it simply circumvented it. One doesn&#8217;t just have to be able to recognize anomie, one must be able to locate its root cause. The directory offered a way for folks to share their information, but didn&#8217;t offer any reason <em>why</em> they should do so—I didn&#8217;t do anything to affect cultural change. The design problem that I was attempting to address was that there were lots of individual projects taking place with no resource sharing or collaboration between them. My directory was icing: it was a neat way for information to be shared. What was really needed was a substantive cake, which, in this situation would have been a reason for sharing resources and ideas—a reason to connect and collaborate. While the directory is a useful tool, it isn&#8217;t one that can fix the problem at hand. A true solution&#8217;s design would have incorporated some element of cultural change, or awareness building; a true solution&#8217;s design would have educated, and in so doing begun to form a community around itself.</p>

<h3 id='gravity'><a href='#gravity'>Gravity</a></h3>

<p>So, because anomie is the breakdown of social bonds between folks, any system or design that is going to reduce it needs to have <em>gravity</em>, or the ability to strengthen the social bonds between individuals; whereas anomie separates or distances individuals, gravity brings them together. The primary way that a system can accumulate gravity—the power to draw people together—is with what I call a <em>social swale</em>.</p>

<h3 id='social_swale'><a href='#socialSwale'>Social swale</a></h3>

<p>A swale (a normal one, as opposed to a social one) is a simple form of water catchment: a ditch dug on contour with the land so that, with the help of gravity, as water travels across the landscape it is made to pool in a certain place—then soak in—gradually replenishing the water table of a certain area. Swales refocus and concentrate water so that it can be used for a specific purpose, e.g. nourishing plants. In much the same manner a <em>social</em> swale captures, refocuses, and concentrates human attention as it travels across a landscape (landscapes that can be digital, textual, pragmatic, and/or geographic).</p>

<p><em>Harry Potter</em> is an example of a social swale with very high gravity. In other words, the phenomenon of <em>Harry Potter</em>—the international, multi-generational obsession with the fictional world, empowers people to connect with one-another. As an example, my wife and I recently ate at a cafe, and when Virginia mentioned to a friend that she was spending her vacation re-reading the series, a waitress joined in on the conversation. Virginia and the waitress subsequently connected over their feelings of nostalgia when reading the books. The gravity in this situation is their shared experience, not simply of reading the books, but of feeling personally connected to them.</p>

<p>A social swale is any system that mediates one&#8217;s experience in such a manner that one&#8217;s attention is made to linger on something other than one&#8217;s own self. Importantly, in order to be a positive force for combatting anomie, a social swale needs to cause one&#8217;s attention to connect with someone else rather than with a service, device, or application. This connection can happen directly—e.g. with something like Waze—or this connection can happen indirectly—e.g. with something like <em>Harry Potter</em>—where the social swale becomes a shared experience around which people can connect, after having individually connected with it.</p>

<p>Like many definitions, however, this one is problematic. Some social swales are positive in one aspect, but aren&#8217;t in another. Consider the simultaneous connectedness and retreat encouraged by technology that novelist Jonathan Safran Foer earlier described. Cell phones, for instance, enable almost constant connectedness with others, while also enabling a retreat from people, experiences, and environments close-by.</p>

<p>So, the question now is how does an IX designer create a system that creates consistently and progressively positive connectivity?</p>
