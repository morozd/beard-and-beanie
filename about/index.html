    <h1>What I do</h1>
    <p>
     I specialize in making lightweight, mobile ready, and easily maintainable websites that are cheap or even free to host. My great-grandfather was a sign painter and I think of designing for the web a lot like he thought of sign painting: I'm making something that is going to be a businesses face; that first point of contact; a transmitter of important information; a hook to draw people in; a &quot;once upon a time.&quot; I hand craft each site to your particular needs.

      Websites aren't the only thing that I do, however! Need that new printer installed, or a network setup? I have got you covered. Do you want to set up a new e-mail address using a custom domain name? I can do that too. Would you like to catalog and digitize some old photos, or how about build a database of clients, or an archive of family heirlooms? I would love to help you with all of these things and more&mdash;think of me as your digital handyman.
